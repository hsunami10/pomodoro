COMMENT ON COLUMN account.id IS 'recommended to not use serial: https://stackoverflow.com/q/64016778/9477827';

COMMENT ON COLUMN habit.account_id IS 'A nullable account_id means it is not linked to an account - so it is a "preset" habit.

Preset habits are created by devs and cannot be changed by users.
- habits with a non-null `account_id` are created by users
- habits with a null `account_id` are "preset" habits that users can choose from';

| every other day (every 2 days) | daily            | 2          |
| every week                     | weekly           | 1          |
| every 2 weeks                  | weekly           | 2          |

COMMENT ON COLUMN habit.days_of_week IS '3-character strings, separated by commas.
Examples:
- weekends - `sat,sun`
- monday, wednesday, friday - `mon,wed,fri`

The max length would be every day of the week:
- each day is 3 characters long
- 7 days a week
- one semi-colon in between each (6 total)
So... `(3 * 7) + 6 = 27`.';

COMMENT ON COLUMN habit.days_of_month IS '2-character numbers, separated by commas.
Examples:
- 1st of the month - `01`
- 1st, 7th, 14th, 21st - `01,07,14,21`

The max length would be every day of the month:
- each day is 2 characters long
- max 31 days in a month
- one semi-colon in between each (30 total)
So... `(2 * 31) + 30 = 92`';

COMMENT ON COLUMN habit.months_of_year IS '3-character strings, separated by commas.
Examples:
- april - `apr`
- (Q1-Q4) january, april, july, october - `jan,apr,jul,oct`

The max length would be every month of the year:
- each month is 3 characters long
- max 12 months in a year
- one semi-colon in between each (11 total)
So... `(3 * 12) + 11 = 47`';
